        <p>Hi, I’m Cynthia Mugo — a passionate photographer with over 5 years of professional experience behind the lens.
            Photography, for me, is more than just a skill; it's a way of connecting with the world around me. I’m especially drawn to the beauty of nature, which is why you’ll often find me capturing candid moments during hikes, long drives, visits to museums, and quiet walks through parks. There’s something magical about preserving the stillness of a forest trail or the energy of a city sunset.
            I’m also a devoted astronomy enthusiast, and one of my favorite pastimes is photographing the night sky — from dazzling stars to meteor showers and every cosmic moment in between.
            Whether I’m chasing sunlight through leaves or waiting patiently for the perfect sky shot, my goal is always the same: to freeze time in a frame, and share the wonder I see with you.</p>
